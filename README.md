# Weather_App
I built a weather app using JavaScript and an API to fetch real-time weather data. 
The app takes a city name as input, fetches the weather details using the API, and displays information like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. 
I used an existing HTML & CSS template for the UI and focused on implementing the logic in JavaScript for fetching and displaying the data dynamically.
